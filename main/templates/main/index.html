    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        It’s 1am on a summer Friday. You are siting in the garden with your other half watching the stars.
        Random thoughts come and go, when one stays. It’s the most brilliant thought you had all week!
        It feels solid, almost complete, only details remain unresolved. You want to write about it. But where?
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s an obvious realisation: this is an idea worth writing in a blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        You knew this day would come. Now you have to setup a blog. But again, where? All blog platforms,
        one way or another, come up short. The future is self published. But you want to just write!
        Not choosing between static site generators and hosting providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter mataroa.blog: the blogging unplatform.
    </p>
    <p>
        With mataroa you can start writing immediately, and worry later about the long term future of your blog.
        Feel free to write as much as you want, and when you are ready to own your bytes, click <b>EXPORT TO <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">ZOLA</a></b>,
        and you will be immediately offered to download a zip archive containing all your posts in a <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> structure
        (the most famous—and very fast static site generator). Just `unzip`, `cd`, run `hugo serve`, and enjoy a real
        craftsman’s ownership. What a joy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or feel free to also stay. Enjoy our ridiculously cheap hosting ($5 per year), with minimal JavaScript,
        zero tracking, two cookies (csrftoken and sessionid) and lightning fast service.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        If you do stay, consider upgrading to premium ($25 per year) to luxuriate yourself with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comments</li>
        <li>Backend-based analytics</li>
        <li>Image hosting</li>
        <li>Drafts</li>
        <li>Post creation via email</li>
        <li>Styling options</li>
    </ul> -->
