    <h1>Comments Guide</h1>
    <p>
        Mataroa supports comments on a blog post level. Comments are optional
        and can be enabled blog-wide from the
        <a href="{% url 'user_update' %}">settings page</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comments are optionally eponymous.</li>
        <li>
            There are no configuration options for comments other than enabling
            them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blog authors get an email notification when there is a new comment
            in any of their posts.
        </li>
        <li>Commenters do not get any notification, in any case.</li>

        {% if comments_moderation_on %}
        <li>
            All comments are held for moderation.
        </li>
        <li>
            The comment review process can take up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        {% else %}
        <li>
            There is no moderation on comments. Unfortunately, if a blog gets
            shared somewhere public very capable spammers will not hold back.
        </li>
